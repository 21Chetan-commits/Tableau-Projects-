**Tableau – Insights From the Dashboard**
This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance across customer segments, product categories, and geographic regions.
It combines bar charts, maps, heatmaps, scatter plots, and treemaps to highlight both trends and deep insights.

**Key Insights from the Dashboard**
	**•	Consumer segment drives the highest sales,** especially in the West region.
	**•	Technology and Office Supplies** generate the most sales across categories, with Technology performing strongest.
	**•	City-level map visualization** highlights major sales hubs across the United States.
	**•	Profit Margin scatter plot** shows a strong positive correlation between sales and profit — but also identifies several loss-making orders.
	**•	Regional Sales heatmap** reveals significant performance differences across sub-categories and regions (e.g., Phones, Chairs, and Storage perform strongly in multiple regions).
	**•	Treemap analysis** shows Technology and Furniture sub-categories dominating contribution to total profit.
